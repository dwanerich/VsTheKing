        "VSTHEKING” hails from Trenton, NJ. However in 96 he moved to Queens, NY to find his own way of life. At that
        moment in
        time his mother was serving a 22 year prison sentence and he moved with his father. Despite this, “VSTHEKING”
        always had
        music as his only outlet from drama in his childhood. Throughout his childhood he was seen as a loner due to
        always
        being on the sidelines being creative. He took a hands-on approach to using his creativity to fix bikes in the
        neighborhood or to fix anything broken around the house.

        From birth he also had a passion for music as a means to express his creative side. He would freestyle his
        favorite rap
        songs and eventually started to write his own lyrics. In NYC he made a name for himself as a freestyle rapper
        known as
        Versatile. He was on the street team for Bad Boy Records and paid his dues by hanging up posters. His star power
        was
        also seen in MTV commercials for Direct Effect and TRL. VS caught the acting bug and appeared in a movie called
        Underground PD. His talents were then seen in music placements such as Fredro Starr's solo project - Firestarr.
        He
        followed that appearance with an Onyx music collaboration on the album “BackDaFucUp”pt:2.

        He decided to move onto ghostwriting songs for other artists. That move helped him to keep his pen game ready at
        all
        times. His shyness never stopped him from going after his dreams to set goals out of reach. However in 2007 his
        dreams
        turned into nightmares as he was brought up on charges of murder in the 2nd degree. For two years he sat in a
        cell on
        Rikers Island before making bail. In 2009 he made some quick moves due to not knowing the potential outcome for
        his
        future. He continued to make music but lost it due to not having a stable place to lay his head. In 2010
        VSTHEKING was
        sentenced to 19 years in prison. Despite this nightmare, he continued to use music as an escape.

        Through all of his trials and tribulations, music remained his best friend. He collaborated with Black Rob on
        the
        UNRELEASED song called “Paid Dues”. Today VSTHEKING has a new leash on life and his past is in the rear view
        mirror. Now
        it’s only up from here and he sees no downs in his future. He continues to work on his music. His new album
        “Trillion
        Dollar Dreams” is a work of art. He lives happily with his wife and continues to dedicate himself to his craft.
        He’s
        truly the voice of the underdog, the essence of a champion, and the heart of a lion as “VSTHEKING”. He goes so
        hard
        everyday to protect his legacy of “VSTHEKING” and it’s only up from here.
